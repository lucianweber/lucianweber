# Hi! I'm Lucian ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a hands-on engineering leader with a strong technical background, but what really drives me is building great products with great people. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the chance to work across various industries, countries, and teams - building products loved by millions of users. This has taught me that building great products always starts with caring for the people.
