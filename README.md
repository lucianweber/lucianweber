# Hi! I'm Lucian ðŸ‘‹ and I love Software.

I have years of experience as a Software Engineer building web-services involving frontend- and backend development, system architecture and database design.

Or in different words: I love building products with Web-Technologies. I am really focused on identifying and solving the problems that deliver the best possible value to the user. I enjoy beeing a teamplayer and love to share my experience and knowledge to help others.
